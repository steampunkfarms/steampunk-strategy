# Surrender Deflection & Guided Rehoming System

**Status:** Planning — All policy decisions resolved  
**Priority:** High — addresses daily operational pain point  
**Platform:** Rescue Barn (rescuebarn.steampunkfarms.org)  
**Related:** Surrender Prevention resources (existing), Socratic Sanctuary Method (existing pattern)  
**Date:** February 24, 2026

## The Problem

People find us via Google ("animal sanctuary near me"), visit our website, email us, submit contact forms, and increasingly message us on Facebook/Instagram asking us to take their animals — roosters, pigs, dogs, cats, horses, goats, you name it.

**Our mission is shelter-bound animals in municipal shelters.** We can't and shouldn't absorb private surrenders. But right now our response is informal: say no, give some ad hoc guidance, repeat. There's no structured process, no tracking, no automation, and no way to know if our advice worked or if people followed through.

We feel badly saying no, but it's unrealistic to accept these animals given our charter. What we *can* do is fill a gap no one else in this industry is filling: give people a structured, guided, tracked pathway to take ownership of rehoming their animals responsibly.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Compassionate but firm** — We understand life changes. We still hold people accountable.
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Don't overwhelm. Give 3 steps. When those don't work, give the next 3.
3. **Tracked & resumable** — People log in, we remember where they are, they can come back.
4. **Feedback loop** — We learn what works, what doesn't, and why.
5. **Responsibility transfer, not burden transfer** — The goal is never "dump the animal on a rescue." The goal is the person completing the process.
6. **Incremental commitment** — When sanctuary placement is the outcome, the person commits to ongoing support (financial + volunteer), not a handoff.

---

## Intake Channels & Triage

### Channels (in order of current volume)
1. **Website contact form** — Primary. Can automate response immediately.
2. **Email** (direct to info@) — Second most common. Can automate with templates + links.
3. **Website chatbot** (future) — When enabled, can handle inline with the guided system.
4. **Facebook Messenger** — Manual for now; canned response template redirecting to website form.
5. **Instagram DMs** — Manual for now; canned response template redirecting to website form.

### Social Media Protocol (Decided)
All social media surrender inquiries funnel to one place: the website contact form. Three-layer approach:
- **Auto-reply** on FB/IG for all new messages — immediate acknowledgment + link to website form
- **Canned response template** for team to copy/paste — compassionate, explains mission focus, links to Guided Rehoming Pathway on the website
- **Destination is always the form** — one funnel, one tracking system, no fragmented conversations across platforms

### Auto-Triage Logic
When a submission mentions surrendering/rehoming/placement of a personal animal:
- **Auto-response** with empathy + link to the Guided Rehoming Pathway
- **Classify** the life-change trigger (if discernible): general rehome, loss of loved one, job/financial loss, disaster displacement, lifestyle change, behavioral issue with animal
- **Route** to the appropriate sub-pathway

---

## Stage 1: Guided Rehoming Pathway (Authenticated)

Modeled after the existing Socratic Sanctuary Method pattern — a visual timeline card progression that users walk through step by step. Requires Google/Facebook login so progress is saved.

### Pathway Entry: Disclaimer + Consent (Clickwrap)
Before any steps unlock, the user must acknowledge:
- This is a guidance tool, not professional advice
- Steampunk Farms does not guarantee outcomes
- The user assumes responsibility for their own decisions
- Steampunk Farms does not endorse specific organizations in the resource directory
- Data will be used for outcome tracking; optional consent for anonymized case study use
- **If your animal is in immediate danger, contact local animal control or call 911. This pathway is for planned rehoming, not emergency rescue.**

### Step 1: "First Steps" (Unlocked immediately)
Three concrete actions the person must attempt before proceeding:

- **Post in your personal network** — Template provided for social media post, community boards, Nextdoor, local Facebook groups. Includes photo tips, what to say, what NOT to say.
- **Contact breed/species-specific rescues** — We provide a curated list or search tool by species, breed, and region. Script template for what to say when contacting them.
- **Check local rehoming platforms** — Rehome.org, Adopt-a-Pet owner surrender, Craigslist (with safety guidelines), local shelter transfer programs.

**Completion criteria:** User marks each as attempted and provides brief outcome notes.

### Step 2: "Expand Your Search" (Unlocks after Step 1)
Next tier of actions for when the basics didn't work:

- **Contact your veterinarian** — Vets often know clients looking for animals; provide a script.
- **Reach out to breed/species clubs and associations** — Regional and national organizations.
- **Check sanctuary directories** — Curated directory (see Partner Sanctuary Network policy below). GFAS-accredited sanctuaries first, species-specific sanctuary networks. Always multiple options, never a single referral.
- **Explore foster-to-adopt arrangements** — Temporary placement while searching for permanent home.

**Completion criteria:** User marks each as attempted with outcome notes. Feedback collected on directory referrals: "Did they respond? Were they helpful? Did they accept your animal?"

### Step 3: "Creative Solutions" (Unlocks after Step 2)
For when standard channels are exhausted:

- **Behavioral consultation** — If the surrender reason is behavioral, connect to low-cost training/behavior resources. Sometimes the animal can stay with minor intervention.
- **Financial assistance** — If the reason is financial, connect to pet retention programs, food banks, veterinary assistance funds.
- **Temporary housing** — Foster networks, barn/pasture sharing arrangements for livestock.
- **Collaborative placement** — Work with multiple rescues/sanctuaries to find placement across a network rather than single-organization asks.

**Completion criteria:** User marks as attempted with outcome notes.

### Step 4: "Sanctuary Placement Preparation" (Unlocks after Step 3)
Only reached when self-rehoming genuinely hasn't worked:

- **Understand the commitment** — Educational content on what it means to place an animal at a sanctuary (it's not free, it's not a drop-off, you retain moral responsibility).
- **Prepare an animal profile** — Medical records, behavioral notes, dietary needs, history — everything a receiving organization needs.
- **Financial commitment pledge** — 12-month recurring donation to whichever sanctuary accepts the animal. Species-scaled tiers with pre-selected middle option (see Financial Commitment policy below). No zero option — commitment is required to proceed.
- **Volunteer commitment** — Commit to visiting/volunteering if local, or remote advocacy if distant.

### Step 5: "Placement & Ongoing Support" (Post-placement)
After an animal has been placed at a sanctuary:

- **Check-in schedule** — Monthly prompts for the first 3 months, then quarterly.
- **Donation tracking** — Gentle reminders tied to their pledge commitment.
- **Volunteer logging** — Track visits and volunteer hours.
- **Social sharing encouragement** — Post about the sanctuary, your experience, model responsibility for others.

### Step 6: "Beyond 12 Months — Becoming an Advocate" (Transformation phase)
At the 12-month mark of their commitment:

- **Celebrate the milestone** — Acknowledge they followed through.
- **Encourage continuation** — Present the case for ongoing support (even reduced).
- **Broaden the lens** — Introduce them to broader animal advocacy: local volunteer opportunities near them, online advocacy ("keyboard warriors"), the Advocacy Academy, etc.
- **Transform the experience** — Take this major life milestone and channel the energy into sustained advocacy, whether local volunteering, remote support, or formal education through the Academy.

### The Failure Path (End of Pipeline)
When someone completes all steps and still hasn't placed their animal:

**Public-facing:** The pathway ends with a "Let Us Know" form — captures their full situation, documents everything they've tried, goes to the team for human review. Framed as "maybe we know someone or have an idea you haven't tried." Encouragement to keep active listings going. **No mention anywhere that surrendering to a municipal shelter is an option.**

**Internal-facing:** In rare cases, after a person has demonstrably completed every step and genuinely exhausted all options, the team may choose to accept the animal directly. This is a case-by-case judgment call — never promised, never implied in the system, never presented as a possible outcome in the pathway UI. The person doesn't know this door exists until the team opens it for them. This protects grant compliance (mission is municipal shelter and hoarding cases), pipeline integrity (nobody gaming toward a "Steampunk Farms takes my animal" outcome), and the animal (policy rigidity doesn't override the right answer when someone genuinely tried).

## Stage 2: Life-Change Sub-Pathways

Each sub-pathway shares the core step structure above but with tailored resources, language, and urgency levels. All sub-pathways include crisis routing language: "If your animal is in immediate danger, contact local animal control or call 911."

### A. General Rehome
- Default pathway
- Standard timeline, standard steps
- Lowest urgency classification

### B. Loss of a Loved One
- Compassionate framing — "Mom's dog needs a home"
- Faster initial steps (the animal may be in limbo)
- Estate/legal considerations (who technically owns the animal?)
- Grief-aware language throughout
- Connection to pet loss support resources

### C. Financial Hardship / Job Loss
- Emphasis on pet retention resources FIRST (food banks, vet assistance, temporary help)
- Many people don't need to surrender — they need a bridge
- Financial counseling resources
- Timeline-sensitive: how long until situation stabilizes?

### D. Disaster Displacement (Wildfire, Flood, etc.)
- **Two sub-phases:**
  - **Immediate/acute** — Temporary housing, emergency foster, evacuation resources (links to existing wildfire prep resources on our site). **Crisis Custody (Track A) available here** for cats, dogs, and smaller animals.
  - **Long-term displacement** — House burned down, months/years before stable housing returns. Transitions to permanent pathway (Track B) if Crisis Custody window expires.
- Insurance guidance — when a payout comes, a portion supports the animal's care
- Emotional support resources — disaster trauma is real
- Livestock-specific resources (horses, cattle, goats, pigs have different emergency housing needs than pets). **Livestock defaults to Track B (permanent surrender pathway) from the start** due to herd/flock integration complexity.

### E. Behavioral Issues
- Redirect to behavioral resources BEFORE rehoming
- Low-cost training, veterinary behaviorists
- Species-specific behavior guides
- Assessment: is this actually a behavior problem or a knowledge gap?

---

## Stage 3: Feedback & Analytics Engine

### What We Track
- **Pathway completion rates** — How many people finish all steps vs. drop off (and where)
- **Step effectiveness** — Which steps lead to successful rehoming outcomes?
- **User feedback** — "This worked" / "This didn't work" + free-text on why
- **Directory referral quality** — Which listed sanctuaries respond, accept, provide good outcomes?
- **Time to resolution** — How long from first contact to outcome?
- **Outcome types** — Self-rehomed, placed with rescue, placed with sanctuary, kept the animal, unknown/abandoned process
- **Channel attribution** — Did they come from the form, email, chatbot, social?

### How We Use It
- Refine step content based on what people report isn't working
- Identify regional resource gaps
- Curate and improve the sanctuary directory based on referral outcome data
- Build case studies (anonymized, with explicit user consent) for the Academy and The Bray
- Demonstrate impact for grant applications ("We guided X people through responsible rehoming")
- Identify patterns that suggest new resources we need to create
- Feed directory performance data into Partner Sanctuary Network development (Phase 2 warm referrals)

---

## Stage 4: Automation & Integration

### Phase 1 (MVP — Can build now)
- Auto-response email template when surrender keywords detected in contact form
- Canned social media response template + FB/IG auto-reply setup
- Guided pathway as a new Socratic Sanctuary Method pathway (uses existing infrastructure)
- Basic progress tracking via Supabase (same pattern as Academy progress)
- Curated sanctuary directory with disclaimer and vetting criteria documented
- Manual email follow-ups at key milestones

### Phase 2 (Near-term)
- Chatbot integration — pathway steps delivered conversationally
- Automated milestone emails via Resend (completion of each step, nudges for stalled users)
- Resource directory with search by species + region
- Feedback collection integrated into each step completion
- Warm referral outreach to top-performing directory sanctuaries (6-12 months of data)

### Phase 3 (Future)
- AI-personalized guidance (Socratic Sanctuary Method Phase 2 AI integration)
- Facebook/Instagram Messenger bot integration
- Selective formal MOUs with 2-3 proven partner sanctuaries
- Sanctuary network coordination (multi-org placement matching)
- Donor/volunteer commitment tracking dashboard
- Integration with Postmaster for animals that do enter our care through this pipeline

## Policy Decisions (All Resolved)

### Policy 1: Return Policy — Two-Track Model

**No return policy needed.** Instead, two legally and operationally distinct tracks:

**Track A: Crisis Custody (Temporary)**
- For disaster displacement, medical emergency, short-term housing loss
- Person retains ownership throughout
- 90-day limit + one 30-day extension (120 days max)
- Required monthly check-ins
- Financial contribution required: "contribute what you can" model
- Auto-converts to Track B if deadline passes without reclaim
- **Available for cats, dogs, and smaller animals only.** Livestock defaults to Track B from the start due to herd/flock integration complexity.

**Track B: Permanent Surrender**
- For all other situations, and what Track A converts to if timeline expires
- Full transfer of ownership, irrevocable
- Standard sanctuary surrender agreement
- Person commits to ongoing financial support + volunteer involvement (Steps 4-6)
- No right to reclaim

### Policy 2: Financial Commitment — Species-Scaled Tiers

**Show real costs. Suggest a percentage. Pre-select the middle.**

For each species/group, display actual monthly care cost as anchor, then three tiers + "Other amount":
- Low tier (covers feed)
- **Middle tier (covers feed + routine care) ← pre-selected**
- High tier (covers most care)
- Other amount field (no zero option)

Using industry averages at launch, refined with actual Steampunk Farms costs later:
- Cats/small animals: ~$50/mo care cost → tiers around $10 / $20 / $35
- Goats/sheep/pigs: ~$150/mo care cost → tiers around $25 / $50 / $100
- Horses/cattle/donkeys: ~$400/mo care cost → tiers around $75 / $150 / $250

The real cost anchor makes the suggested tier feel reasonable. Pre-selecting the middle leverages the strongest behavioral finding. No zero option — this is a commitment step, not an optional donation.

**Crisis Custody (Track A) uses "contribute what you can"** — different context, temporary hardship, appropriate to be softer.

### Policy 3: Direct Intake — Never Through This Pipeline

**The surrender pipeline never results in direct intake to Steampunk Farms, period.** This is a guidance service, not an intake channel. Direct intake comes only through municipal shelter partnerships and rescue operations, through completely separate channels.

**Internal exception (never surfaced to users):** In rare cases, after demonstrable completion of all pathway steps, the team may choose to accept an animal. Case-by-case, never promised, never implied. See "Failure Path" section above.

### Policy 4: Social Media Response Protocol

**All social media surrender inquiries funnel to the website contact form.** Three layers:
1. **Auto-reply** on FB/IG — immediate acknowledgment + link to website form
2. **Canned response template** — compassionate, mission-focused, links to Guided Rehoming Pathway
3. **Destination is always the form** — one funnel, one tracking system

### Policy 5: Partner Sanctuary Network — Phased Approach

**Phase 1 (Launch): Curated Directory with Disclaimer**
- Curated list by species and region — GFAS-accredited first, then verified 501(c)(3) with track records
- Clear disclaimer: not affiliated, cannot guarantee services, user responsible for due diligence
- Always multiple options per species (3-5), never a single referral
- Feedback loop built into pathway steps — users report on directory referral quality
- Document vetting criteria (creates defensible record)

**Phase 2 (After 6-12 months of data): Warm Referral Network**
- Reach out to top-performing sanctuaries from directory data
- Offer "Steampunk Farms Referral Partner" listing (badge on directory)
- Exchange contact names for warm introductions
- No binding agreements — mutual awareness and communication channel
- Modeled on Farm Sanctuary's FAAN approach

**Phase 3 (When volume justifies): Selective Formal MOUs**
- Only with 2-3 sanctuaries with proven track records from Phase 2
- Lightweight: shared intake form, 72-hour response commitment, 30-day termination clause
- Explicitly does NOT cover care standards (their domain), guaranteed acceptance (their capacity), or ongoing animal reporting (their operational call)
- Neither party represents the other publicly without permission

### Policy 6: Liability — Draft Now, Legal Review Before Launch

**Statutory protections already in place:**
- Federal Volunteer Protection Act (covers 501(c)(3) volunteers absent willful misconduct)
- California Corporations Code § 5047.5 (officer/director immunity, conditional on insurance)
- Nonprofit corporate shield (Steampunk Farms is incorporated)

**Protections built into the system:**
1. Pathway disclaimer at entry (educational purpose, not professional advice, no guaranteed outcomes)
2. Clickwrap consent checkbox (acknowledges terms before accessing pathway)
3. Resource directory disclaimer (not affiliated, cannot guarantee, user does own due diligence)
4. Crisis routing language in all sub-pathways ("If your animal is in immediate danger, contact animal control or call 911")
5. Multiple options, never single referrals (reduces implied endorsement)
6. No custody transfer through our system (we never touch the animal)
7. All interactions logged by design (digital paper trail)
8. Explicit consent checkbox on feedback for anonymized case study use

**Four documents to draft before launch:**
1. Pathway Disclaimer (visible at Step 1)
2. Consent Checkbox Language (clickwrap at pathway entry)
3. Resource Directory Disclaimer (on directory page)
4. Crisis Routing Language (embedded in sub-pathways)

**⚠️ ACTION ITEM: Verify general liability and D&O insurance status.** California statutory protection for board/officers is conditional on maintaining minimum liability insurance ($500K for budgets under $50K). This matters more than any disclaimer language.

### Policy 7: Failure Path — Compassionate Dead End with Hidden Door

**Public-facing:** "Let Us Know" form at the end of the pipeline. Captures full situation and documented attempts. Goes to team for human review. No promise attached. No mention that municipal shelter surrender is an option (prevents shortcutting by lazy/unscrupulous people who would self-soothe with "well now Steampunk Farms will have to take care of them").

**Internal-facing:** Rare, case-by-case direct intake after demonstrable pathway completion. Never promised, never implied, never visible in the UI. Protects grant compliance, pipeline integrity, and the animal.

## Implementation Priority

| Phase | What | Depends On | Effort |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| **Done** | Planning document + all policy decisions | Nothing | ✅ Complete |
| **Pre-build** | Legal review of 4 disclaimer documents; verify insurance | Nothing | Small (1-2 hrs attorney time) |
| **Phase 1** | Auto-response templates, social media canned response, pathway in SSM, curated directory | Legal review complete | Medium |
| **Phase 2** | Progress tracking, milestone emails via Resend, feedback collection | Phase 1 stable | Medium |
| **Phase 3** | Analytics dashboard, directory curation from feedback data | Phase 2 + usage data | Medium |
| **Phase 4** | Chatbot, messenger integration, warm referral outreach | Phase 1-3 stable + 6-12 months data | Large |
| **Phase 5** | AI personalization, formal MOUs, sanctuary network coordination | Phase 4 + partnerships | Large |

## Relationship to Existing Systems

- **Surrender Prevention resources** (existing on /resources) — These become the reference library that the guided pathway links to at each step.
- **Socratic Sanctuary Method** — The guided pathway IS a new SSM pathway, using the same visual timeline card progression and signal-based branching.
- **Advocacy Academy** — Successful pathway completers who become advocates are natural Academy prospects. Anonymized case studies feed Academy content.
- **Postmaster** — Animals that do enter our care through the rare internal exception get tracked in Postmaster like any other resident.
- **The Bray (blog)** — Anonymized success stories (with consent) from the pathway become blog content.
- **TARDIS / Orchestrator** — Automated nudge emails, milestone checks, and stalled-user outreach become scheduled jobs.
- **Cleanpunk Shop** — Potential for mission-aligned merchandise tie-ins (e.g., "I rehomed responsibly" items).
