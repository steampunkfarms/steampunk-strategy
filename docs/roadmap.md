## 🔴 Active Handoffs (specs in docs/handoffs/)

None currently active.

---

## 🔴 Priority One — Do Next

### Receipt OCR End-to-End Test
**Status:** Pipeline fully built, awaiting test data
**Blocked by:** Historical documents in briefcase (in daughter's car)
**What's built:** Upload → Claude Vision parse → review panel → create transaction. Full UI with drag-and-drop, confidence gauge, line item extraction, CostTracker integration.
**When unblocked:** Photograph Elston's invoice + Tractor Supply receipt, test on /documents page
**Repo:** steampunk-strategy

### Gmail Compliance Notice Scanner (TARDIS Phase B, #94)
**Priority:** High — government notices need detection + critical alert routing
**Scope:** Extend existing gmail-receipt-scan cron to detect government notices, renewal deadlines, compliance letters. Classifier for known sender map (CA SOS, IRS, FTB, CDTFA, etc.). Critical alert routing.
**Prerequisite:** Orchestrator registration deployed ✅
**Repo:** steampunk-strategy

---

## 🟡 Priority Two — High Value, Needs Handoff Spec

### Animal Affinity Pipeline (Studiolo #28)
**Priority:** Medium (downgraded — mostly built)
**What exists:** Full pipeline: Cleanpunk webhook → product→animal mapping via `cleanpunk-constants.ts` → Postmaster roster cross-ref → Donor model boolean flags + `cleanpunkAnimalAffinities[]` → compose context includes `cleanpunkIntelligence.animalAffinities` → voice engine `context-assembler.ts` injects into AI prompt. Platform context has `[ANIMAL_BOND:...]` memory cue tags.
**Gap:** `DonorAnimal` junction table not auto-populated from Cleanpunk purchases. Animal relationships only stored as flat string array on Donor, not in the M:N table that powers `/animals/[id]` relationship views.
**Fix:** Small — add `DonorAnimal.upsert()` call in `sync/cleanpunk-purchases/route.ts` after interest flag computation. Match animal name → Animal record via Postmaster roster. Source = `CLEANPUNK_PURCHASE`.
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

### Meta Comment Harvester + Facebook Matching (#19–20)
**Priority:** High — SocialIdentityQueue + Link/Skip/New UI
**Note:** Reconcile process needs redesign. Page-scoped user ID matching.
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

---

## 🟡 Priority Three — Important, Revisit Soon

### PayPal Gmail Enrichment (#25)
**Priority:** Medium — emails contain notes, addresses, donor data not in API/CSV
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

### Gmail Label Discovery (#23)
**Priority:** Medium — improve email categorization accuracy
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

### Patreon Welcome Email (#8)
**Priority:** Easy win — next week
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

### Lapsed Zeffy Monthly Donor Recapture
**Priority:** Medium — replaces killed Zeffy past-due recovery workflow
**Scope:** When lapsed Zeffy monthly donor detected, trigger recapture into Rescue Barn's Stripe-based donation system.
**Decision:** Zeffy recovery is dead. Org migrating donations to Rescue Barn / Stripe.
**Repos:** steampunk-studiolo + steampunk-rescuebarn

### 990 Preparation Rollup (TARDIS Phase D, #96)
**Priority:** Important but not urgent — needs full fiscal year of clean transaction data
**Scope:** Part VIII/IX rollup from irs990Line mappings, sales tax integration, CSV/PDF export for CPA
**Repo:** steampunk-strategy

### Stripe Tax Sync (TARDIS Phase A, #92)
**Priority:** BLOCKED — CDTFA still has not issued new seller's permit number
**Scope:** New expense categories, /api/sync/stripe-mercantile, SalesTaxSummary model, CDTFA compliance task seed
**Repo:** steampunk-strategy

### Square Component Removal (#26)
**Priority:** Verify during testing — all Square leaving all sites
**Repos:** all
**Rescue Barn status:** Confirmed no `process.env.SQUARE` usage in src — env vars are dead weight, safe to remove.

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Lower Priority

### Patreon Fix Cluster (Studiolo #48–51)
**Priority:** Low — tier mismatch fix, Gmail scanner, renewal touch scheduling, tier ID backfill
**Repo:** steampunk-studiolo

### Grants Management System Phase 3+ (#32–37, 39, 40)
**Deferred to:** After grant season prep + higher-priority Studiolo work
**Note:** Matching gifts (#41, 43–45) paired with GMS dev

### Narrative Arc Tracking (#3) + AI Learning from Edits (#4)
**Priority:** Medium — nice-to-have, not blocking operations

### Content Library Cleanup (#57)
**Priority:** Low — housekeeping, do when convenient

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Studiolo (from Handoff 004)

### Graph Task Sync — Orchestrator Registration
**Priority:** Do when Orchestrator operational
**Scope:** Register `graph-task-sync` cron in Orchestrator job registry (route exists at `app/api/graph/task-sync/cron/route.ts`)

### Graph Calendar — Two-Way Sync
**Priority:** Low — one-way push is sufficient for now
**Scope:** Reading Outlook events back into Studiolo

### Graph Tasks — Completion Webhook
**Priority:** Low — task sync already marks resolved items complete
**Scope:** Webhook from Outlook to auto-resolve Studiolo records when task completed in To Do

### Cue Harvesting — Bulk Re-Harvest
**Priority:** Low — new replies are auto-harvested
**Scope:** Re-run cue extraction across all historical DonorInboxMessages

### Sentiment Dashboard Widget
**Priority:** Low — sentiment visible on individual donor profiles
**Scope:** Trend chart on command-center or stewardship page showing declining/positive sentiment clusters

### Sentiment Alerting
**Priority:** Medium — auto-flag donors with negative sentiment trend for proactive outreach
**Scope:** Detect declining sentiment patterns, create attention queue items

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Voice Engine (from Handoff 002)

### Guardrails Shared Package
**Priority:** Low — both repos have identical copies
**Scope:** Extract `UNIVERSAL_VOICE_GUARDRAILS` into shared npm package or Orchestrator-served endpoint

### Guardrail Drift CI Check
**Priority:** Medium — prevents re-divergence
**Scope:** CI check that verifies guardrails.ts is byte-identical in Postmaster and Studiolo

### HUG Validator Quality Dashboard
**Priority:** Low — violations logged but no dashboard
**Scope:** Track violation frequency over time, identify common AI compliance failures

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Postmaster

### Voice Migration Verification
**Scope:** Verify all 9 generation routes use DB-backed VoiceConfig via buildSystemPrompt(). Bundle type assertion cleanup (#22). Then clean up hardcoded fallbacks (#3–5).
**Blocked by:** Testing pass (Fred to test all Postmaster functions)

### TikTok + UTM/Click Tracking (#7, #10)
**Decision pending:** Both hinge on Facebook throttling experience

### StormPattern Wire-or-Drop (#23)
**Decision:** Wire into UI or remove the model

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Cleanpunk Shop

### Pre-Launch (This Week)
- #1 DNS switch
- #7 Test order pipeline (minor fix needed)
- #8 Partner overrides formatting (rich text not rendering)
- #2 USPS registration (explore PirateShip workaround)
- #5 Review invitation email (blocked by USPS/workaround)

### Post-Launch High Priority
PirateShip/Shippo API (#9), GA4 (#19), Pre-Order Engine (#23), Campaign Builder fix (#24), Storm Builder gaps (#29–32), Product video (#38), Review aggregation (#39), Monthly drop banners (#43), "Funds X animals" counter (#44), Reorder from history (#50), Sanctuary Stories integration (#60)

---

## 🟡 Deferred — Rescue Barn

### Pre-Launch
GA4 + FB Pixel (#3), Visual polish (#4), Accessibility sweep 8 items (#8–15)

**Resolved this session:**
- #7 TARDIS_API_URL: ✅ local `.env.local` set, `.env.local.example` updated. **Needs Vercel env var added** (Production + Preview) → `TARDIS_API_URL=https://tardis.steampunkstudiolo.org`
- #6 `vercel env pull`: Not a code bug — just a Vercel↔local sync gap. Once TARDIS_API_URL is in Vercel, `vercel env pull` will produce a complete file.
- Square env vars (`SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID`, `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT`) confirmed dead in Rescue Barn — zero `process.env.SQUARE` references in src. Safe to remove from `.env.local` and Vercel when convenient.

### Post-Launch
The Bray expansion, Academy Levels 3–4, Mercantile phases, Surrender Deflection, Shelter Visibility, Piggie Smalls' Hub

### RaiseRight
Habit-formation onboarding redesign (#118), Impact page needs Krystal's 60-second how-to video (#119)

---

## ❌ Killed

### Cash App Gmail Parser (Studiolo #22)
**Killed:** 2026-03-01 — Steampunk Farms doesn't use Cash App

### Zeffy Past-Due Recovery Workflow (Studiolo #47)
**Killed:** 2026-03-01 — Replaced with lapsed donor recapture into Rescue Barn Stripe system. Org migrating away from Zeffy for recurring donations.
