# THE CLUCK CREW
**Slug:** `cluck-crew`
**Species Group:** `poultry`
**Accent Color:** `#D4547A` (barn pink)
**Icon:** 🐔
**Tagline:** "Where the hens rule, the roosters reign, and the ducks were never formally invited."

## Hero Copy

They survived cockfighting rings. Battery cages. Backyard breeding operations gone sideways. And one rooster who arrived via certified mail — long story.

Every bird at Steampunk Farms has a past they didn't choose and a future they absolutely deserve. The Cluck Crew is how we fund that future: grain by the ton, veterinary care by the visit, predator-proofing by the post, and enrichment by the handful of mealworms that makes a retired laying hen forget she ever saw the inside of a wire cage.

The ducks weren't technically part of the plan. They showed up, started eating, and never left. We respect the audacity.

Your monthly gift keeps every beak fed, every roost safe, and every reformed rooster crowing at sunrise like he owns the place. He doesn't. But try telling him that.

## Donation Tiers

### $3/month — One Happy Hen
One chicken. One story. Everything she needs to live her best scratch-and-peck life — balanced pellets, high-protein snacks, and the occasional sunflower seed that makes her forget all her troubles. You're not just feeding a bird. You're proving that somebody cares enough to remember she exists.

### $9/month — Flock Friend
Three birds depend on you now. That's Flora and her gossip circle, or maybe a couple of roosters who've learned that sunrise crowing is a privilege, not a competition. At this level you're funding a small community — one that scratches together, roosts together, and absolutely judges you through the fence.

### $15/month — Cluck Commander
Five rescued birds, fully fed, fully cared for, fully convinced you're their favorite person. Whether it's hens plotting elaborate free-range escapes or ducks committing minor food theft in broad daylight, your support keeps the entire operation moving. This is leadership. Feathered leadership, but leadership.

### $30/month — The Flock Hero
Ten shelter-rescued residents. That's an entire wing of the Cluck Crew — cockfighting survivors finding peace, egg-laying retirees discovering grass for the first time, and at least two ducks who contribute nothing but chaos and we love them anyway. At this level, you're not sponsoring birds. You're sponsoring second chances at industrial scale.

## Small Gift Philosophy (for below the tiers)

We love small monthly gifts because they keep the Cluck Crew strong without putting pressure on any one person. If your giving ability changes — and life happens — we'd rather you feel good about the months you were part of the Crew than feel guilty about stepping away. A flock is stronger together, even when a few birds fly off for a while.

# THE GOATS THAT STARE AT HAY
**Slug:** `goats-that-stare-at-hay`
**Species Group:** `goats`
**Accent Color:** `#7B8F3A` (pasture green)
**Icon:** 🐐
**Tagline:** "They see the hay. They want the hay. They will have the hay."

## Hero Copy

There is a look a goat gives you when the hay is late. It is not anger. It is not sadness. It is a very specific form of existential judgment that suggests you have failed not just them, but the entire concept of morning routines.

At Steampunk Farms, we have a lot of goats. Some arrived from overcrowded rescues. Some from neglect situations where the fencing was an afterthought and the feed was worse. Some carry caseous lymphadenitis — CL — a condition that makes them unwelcome at sanctuaries without the space, the science, or the veterinary expertise to manage it safely. We have twenty acres and a farm manager who reads goat immunology papers for fun. They're safe here.

The thing about goats is that they eat. Relentlessly. Philosophically. With a conviction that borders on spiritual practice. Hay is not just food to a goat — it is purpose, ritual, and the organizing principle of the universe.

Your monthly gift keeps the hay coming. It keeps the fencing standing (goats are engineers of escape). It keeps the CL herd healthy and monitored. And it keeps every weird, staring, hay-obsessed resident fed in a place that actually understands them.

## Donation Tiers

### $5/month — One Goat, One Day
Two meals for one goat for one day, every month. That's breakfast hay and dinner hay and the brief existential crisis in between where they contemplate whether the fence is really that sturdy. Five dollars. One goat. Zero skipped lattes required.

### $10/month — The Small Herd
Fifteen goats fed for a day. That's fifteen separate opinions about which section of hay is best, fifteen separate attempts to headbutt the feed bucket, and fifteen goats who are, against all odds, grateful in their own deeply weird way.

### $20/month — The Pack
Thirty goats. Two meals. One day per month where every member of the herd eats because you decided they should. Some of these goats are enormous. Some are tiny and furious. All of them stare at hay with equal intensity.

### $40/month — Herd Therapist
Sixty goats fed. At this level we should be honest: these goats are not providing you therapy. You are providing them therapy. The therapy is hay. The copay is forty dollars. The results are immediate and universally appreciated.

### $80/month — The Full Herd
The entire goat population at Steampunk Farms. One full day. Two meals. Every goat eats because of you. When the sun comes up and every face is in a feed trough, that's your doing. There is no title for this. There doesn't need to be.

### $560/month — One Full Week
Seven days of hay for every goat on the property. Two meals a day. Every day. This is the kind of commitment that goats notice, and goats do not notice much beyond hay and fence integrity. You have their attention.

### $2,427/month — The Full Month
One complete month of hay for the entire herd. Whether you give this once or sustain it monthly, you are singlehandedly responsible for the structural food security of several dozen animals who would eat through a brick wall if it smelled like alfalfa. We'd give you a title but the goats already have one for you and it's not printable.

## CL Herd Note (sidebar or callout)

Some of our goats carry caseous lymphadenitis — a bacterial condition that requires specialized care and dedicated space that most sanctuaries can't provide. Our farm manager, Krystal, has the veterinary expertise and our twenty acres have the room. When you support The Goats That Stare at Hay, you're funding care that literally has nowhere else to go.

# CLOUDER 9
**Slug:** `clouder-9`
**Species Group:** `cats`
**Accent Color:** `#6B7DB3` (twilight blue)
**Icon:** 🐱
**Tagline:** "They don't need you. They allow you."

## Hero Copy

The barn cats of Steampunk Farms did not ask to be rescued. They did not ask for veterinary care, warm sleeping spots, or reliable meals. They did not ask for anything, because cats do not ask. Cats arrive. Cats assess. Cats decide whether you are worth tolerating.

These are the ones who decided to stay.

Clouder 9 is the barn cat colony at Steampunk Farms — not the cats placed through our Feral-to-Barn-Cat program (those found homes elsewhere), but the ones who claimed this barn as their own and have no intention of leaving. They patrol the property at night. They supervise the goats with visible disdain. They appear on fence posts at dawn and vanish by the time you look twice.

They are not cute. They are not cuddly. They are working animals who happen to also be beautiful, mysterious, and entirely indifferent to your opinion of them.

Your monthly gift funds their veterinary care, their food, their parasite prevention, and the general maintenance of an environment that twenty-odd cats have decided meets their standards. For now. They reserve the right to reassess.

## Donation Tiers

### $5/month — Tolerated
One cat. Fed. Vetted. Allowed to continue existing in their presence. Don't expect gratitude. Expect a slow blink from across the barn, once, in low light, that you'll spend the rest of the week thinking about.

### $10/month — Acknowledged
Three cats recognize your contribution. Not verbally. Not physically. But in the way a cat pauses mid-grooming to look in your general direction before resuming. That's acknowledgment. Take it.

### $15/month — Permitted
Five barn cats are healthier because of you. They will never know your name. They don't know anyone's name. But they know when the food appears on schedule, and they know when it doesn't, and the difference between those two things is your fifteen dollars.

### $25/month — Respected
The entire nightshift. Every cat that patrols the barn after dark — checking the perimeter, supervising the hay storage, staring into the middle distance with an intensity that suggests they can see things we cannot. Your support keeps the night watch fed, healthy, and operationally mysterious.

### $50/month — Inner Circle
The full colony. Every cat on the property receives veterinary care, quality food, and parasite prevention because you decided they should. In cat terms, this makes you part of the inner circle. You won't feel any different. That's how you know it's real.

## Colony Note (sidebar or callout)

Clouder 9 is separate from our Feral-to-Barn-Cat placement program. The cats in Clouder 9 are permanent sanctuary residents — they live here because they chose to, and we're honored by the arrangement. Feral-to-Barn-Cat finds working homes for feral cats at farms, ranches, and rural properties throughout Southern California. Different cats, different mission, same commitment to every one of them.
