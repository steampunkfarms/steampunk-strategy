# steampunk-strategy

Cross-project planning and documentation for the Steampunk Farms family of web properties.

This directory is not a deployable application. It holds strategy documents, architecture diagrams, and shared reference material that spans multiple repos.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `FAMILY_OF_SITES.md` | Full inventory of all 4 web properties: tech stacks, integrations, domains, data flows, connection map |

## The Family

| Project | Domain | What It Does |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Rescue Barn** | rescuebarn.steampunkfarms.org | Public-facing sanctuary website |
| **Studiolo** | steampunkstudiolo.org | Donor CRM & internal operations |
| **Postmaster** | postmaster.steampunkstudiolo.org | AI content automation & social syndication |
| **Cleanpunk Shop** | home.cleanpunk.shop | E-commerce storefront (soaps) |

All projects live under the `steampunkfarms` GitHub org and the `steampunk-studiolo` Vercel team.
